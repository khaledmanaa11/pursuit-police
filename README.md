# P2P Cops-and-Robbers — a cop agent and a thief agent

Two autonomous agents — a **cop** and a **thief** — that play a distributed cops-and-robbers
match on a 7×7 grid over a peer-to-peer network with **no central server and no referee**.
Final project for *Orchestration of AI Agents* (University of Haifa).

Each agent is a symmetric [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com) peer: it exposes tools with
`@mcp.tool` and calls the opponent's tools over the same protocol. It never sees the board.
It infers where the opponent is from a decaying scent field and from free-text hints that
may be lies, chooses its action by solving a **simultaneous-move matrix game** over a learned
15-weight positional evaluation, and proves it did not change its mind after seeing the
opponent's move by way of a SHA-256 **commit-reveal** protocol with a mutual end-of-game
audit.

This file is both the user manual (engineering standard §2.1) and the academic report
(§9.4.2, rule 42). Every claim in it points at a file you can open. Where something is not
done, it says so and names what would close it — a README that overstates and a README that
understates are the same defect.

## What this is

| | |
|---|---|
| **Two processes, no shared state** | `config/police/` and `config/thief/` are two independent agents. They share a *library*, never a live game state — sharing state is instant disqualification for information leakage (rule 2). |
| **No referee** | Neither peer arbitrates. `scripts/dev_launch.py` only spawns the two standalone commands; deleting it changes nothing about how a league game runs. |
| **The algorithm decides** | A language model decodes incoming hints and writes outgoing bluff text. It never chooses a move (rule 25), and `scripts/check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` is a CI job that proves no LLM import is reachable from `strategy/`. |
| **The agent never sees the truth** | The live GUI renders a `LocalView` — this seat's own belief — and cannot reach the joint board. `scripts/check_local_truth.py` enforces it at the AST level over 7 modules (rules 8–9). |
| **Board** | 7×7, orthogonal movement, cop starts `(0,0)`, thief starts `(3,3)`, barrier quota 14, move ceiling 35. Every one of those numbers comes from [`docs/PARAMETERS.md`](docs/PARAMETERS.md); none is invented. |

## Status — measured, not asserted

Built in 8 phases mirroring the book's build order (§10.3). The table below is derived from
the verification and gate documents in the repository, **not** from a tracker's own banner.
When they disagree, the artifact wins.

| Phase | What it delivers | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Base game logic — grid, movement, barrier quota, capture | Verified — [`01-VERIFICATION.md`](.planning/phases/01-base-logic/01-VERIFICATION.md) `passed` |
| 2 | FastMCP P2P infrastructure — two processes, localhost | Verified — [`02-VERIFICATION.md`](.planning/phases/02-fastmcp-infrastructure/02-VERIFICATION.md) `passed` |
| 3 | Blind strategy module — the matrix-game mover | Verified — [`03-VERIFICATION.md`](.planning/phases/03-blind-strategy-module-rl-policy/03-VERIFICATION.md) `passed`, 3/3 §10.4 criteria |
| 4 | Language and scent — hints, pheromones, deception | **Executed, not verified.** [`04-VERIFICATION.md`](.planning/phases/04-language-and-scent/04-VERIFICATION.md) reads `human_needed`: all three mechanisms verified *mocked*, and a live-API confirmation of GATE-4 is the single open item |
| 5 | Cloud exposure and tunnelling | **Both §10.4 criteria PASS** — [`GATE-5-MEASUREMENT.md`](docs/phases/phase-5/GATE-5-MEASUREMENT.md), closed on the fourth attempt by two full rounds between two machines on two networks. `05-VERIFICATION.md` still reads `human_needed`; its one open item is a tracker scope decision, not a code gap |
| 6 | Security — commit-reveal, nonce, Step-0 | Verified — [`06-VERIFICATION.md`](.planning/phases/06-security-and-cryptography/06-VERIFICATION.md) `passed`, GATE-6 all three criteria PASS |
| 7 | Reporting shell — Gmail, live GUI, replay viewer | **Executed, NOT verified.** 11 of 12 plans have run; **no `07-VERIFICATION.md` exists**. [`GATE-7-MEASUREMENT.md`](docs/phases/phase-7/GATE-7-MEASUREMENT.md): criteria 2 and 3 PASS, criterion 1 **dry-run PASS + live PENDING** |
| 8 | Submission and league operations | **In progress, not verified** — no `08-VERIFICATION.md` exists. [`docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md`](docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md) is re-derived from the tree on every run of `scripts/check_submission.py` and reports its own remaining gaps |

**Three things this repository does not claim.**

- **No game report has ever been delivered by mail.** Every shipped `config/*/reporting.json`
  reads `"mode": "dry_run"`, which writes the report to disk and transmits nothing. The MIME
  shape, the send-only scope check and the gatekeeper are proven; the live send is PENDING.
- **No league game has been played.** The remote rounds on record are this project's own two
  seats playing each other across two machines, not a match against another team.
- **No games-played figure appears anywhere in this file.** Misreporting it is rule 38, an
  absolute disqualification. The counters are mechanical
  (`config/*/games_played.json`); the *declared* value is a human decision still open, with
  the evidence gathered in
  [`GAMES-PLAYED-RECONSTRUCTION.md`](docs/phases/phase-7/GAMES-PLAYED-RECONSTRUCTION.md).

---

## Installation

**Prerequisites**

- **Python ≥ 3.10** (`pyproject.toml` `requires-python`); developed and measured on 3.11.
- **[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — the only supported package manager. There is no
  `requirements.txt` and `pip` is never used; `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` are the single
  source of dependency truth.
- **Git** ≥ 2.9, for `core.hooksPath`.
- **Tk** for the two GUI processes. It ships with the python.org and `uv`-managed builds; on
  Debian/Ubuntu it is the separate `python3-tk` package.
- No API key is needed to run a game, the test suite, or any quality gate.

**Step by step**

```bash
git clone <this repository>            # see "Companion repository" below
cd final_project
uv sync                                # creates .venv and installs from uv.lock
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks # enables the pre-commit 150-line gate
cp .env-example .env                   # then fill in your own values
uv run python -m pursuit.main --config-dir config/police --check-config
```

The last command is the install check. It prints the resolved role and endpoints and exits
without starting a server:

```
role=police
listen=127.0.0.1:8001
opponent_url=http://127.0.0.1:8002/mcp
```

**Environment setup.** `.env-example` is committed with dummy values and documents every
variable the code reads. Secrets are read with `os.environ.get()` only — never a config
field, never a default, never a file in git (rules 39–40). All of them are optional: unset,
the language provider degrades to a template fallback, the tunnel stays off, and no mail can
be sent.

**Troubleshooting**

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `uv: command not found` | `uv` is not installed. Install it from the link above; do not fall back to `pip`, which this project does not support. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: pursuit` | The command was run outside `uv`. Every command in this file starts with `uv run`. |
| `_tkinter.TclError` / `no display name` | Tk is missing or there is no display. The agents themselves need neither — only `pursuit.gui.*` does. Add `--once` to render one frame and exit. |
| Port 8001/8002 already in use | A previous agent did not shut down. Stop it, or change `net.port` and the peer's `net.opponent_url` in `config/<role>/network.json`. |
| An agent exits with status 1 | That is a **technical loss**, deliberately surfaced as a non-zero exit — including one declared by the Final-Reveal audit after catching a forged or withheld reveal. The reason is in `logs/<role>/<game_id>.jsonl`. |
| The pre-commit hook rejects a file | A file exceeds 150 code lines. **Split it; never compress code to fit.** Never `--no-verify`. |

---

## Usage — running a game

**The league path: two terminals, two processes.** This is exactly how a real match runs, and
the only difference between the two commands is the `--config-dir` flag. Start one agent per
terminal; neither process arbitrates the game and neither is a referee. Start both promptly —
a peer that cannot be reached at handshake time is a distinct, recorded outcome
(`HandshakeOutcome.UNREACHABLE`), not a silent hang.

```bash
uv run python -m pursuit.main --config-dir config/police   # terminal 1
uv run python -m pursuit.main --config-dir config/thief    # terminal 2
```

**Flags of `pursuit.main`**

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--config-dir` | yes | This agent's own configuration directory. Role, listen address and opponent URL all come from there. It is the only way the two commands differ. |
| `--check-config` | no | Load and print the resolved role and endpoints, then exit without starting a server. |

Exit status `0` is a completed game; `1` is a technical loss.

**Local convenience.** One command spawns both of the above as subprocesses and waits:

```bash
uv run python scripts/dev_launch.py
```

It imports nothing from the agent package, decodes no wire message and holds no board
snapshot — it is not a referee (rule 2, D-01). **It plays a real game**, so it advances both
agents' games-played counters by one each. The test suite never does.

**Watching a game live** (a separate process, fed by this seat's published `LocalView`
snapshot — it cannot reach the true board):

```bash
uv run python -m pursuit.gui.live_app \
  --snapshot logs/police/<game_id>.view.json --refresh-ms 500
```

**Replaying and verifying a finished game** (recomputes every commit hash and shows a
verdict banner):

```bash
uv run python -m pursuit.gui.replay_app \
  --artifact game_artifacts/police/log_<game_id>_g01.json --step-ms 400
```

**Flags of both GUI processes**

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--snapshot` (live) | yes | Path to this seat's `<game_id>.view.json`, written beside the wire log. |
| `--artifact` (replay) | yes | Path to a sealed `log_<game_id>_g<NN>.json`. A `.jsonl` path is refused with exit 2 and a message naming rule 18. |
| `--refresh-ms` / `--step-ms` | yes | Redraw interval. **Deliberately has no default**: no document in the project supplies this number, so the operator states it rather than the code inventing one. |
| `--once` | no | Render a single frame and exit — used by the automated checks, and useful without a display. |

---

## Examples and screenshots

**A complete game, end to end, from a clean checkout:**

```bash
uv sync
uv run python scripts/dev_launch.py                 # plays one real game
ls game_artifacts/police                            # the sealed artifacts
uv run python -m pursuit.gui.replay_app --once \
  --artifact game_artifacts/police/log_<game_id>_g01.json --step-ms 400
```

A finished game leaves four kinds of artifact, named and specified in
[`docs/PARAMETERS.md`](docs/PARAMETERS.md) — `declaration_<game_id>.json`,
`config_<game_id>_g<NN>.json`, `log_<game_id>_g<NN>.json` and `result_<game_id>.json`. Each
seat writes its **own** copy from its **own** wire log; nothing is merged.

**Reading the strategy without running anything:**

```bash
uv run python -c "import json; d=json.load(open('config/police/weights.json')); \
print(dict(zip(d['feature_names'], d['weights'])))"
```

**Screenshots.** Both are required by §9.4.2 item 5. Each was taken by a human against a real
game (`2582a94c8a5ec618`), and the refresh interval is recorded beside it because **no document
in this project states one** — the operator supplies it and the repository holds no default
(OQ-6; both apps take it as a required argument with no fallback).

### The live dashboard — local truth only

![live dashboard showing this seat's own cell, its own declared barrier, and a near-uniform belief heat map over the opponent](docs/assets/live-gui-heatmap.png)

*Police seat, turn 5, `--refresh-ms 500`.*

Two cells are lit on the board panel: this seat's **own cell** `(2, 2)` and its **own declared
barrier** `(2, 3)`. Both are local truth — a barrier this agent placed and declared under rule 22.
The opponent's true position appears nowhere, in any panel.

The belief panel is the visible half of the rules 8–9 firewall. It reads **entropy 5.60 bits
against a 5.6147-bit maximum, 49 of 49 cells lit**, peak at `(1, 5)`. That near-uniformity is the
point: the *strategy* layer's posterior on this turn is sharp, because the engine folds in the
opponent's honest Reveal, and publishing it would have named the true cell by geometry alone. The
published belief is a separate map that is never seeded from ground truth
([`docs/PRD_display_belief.md`](docs/PRD_display_belief.md)). The structural half of the same
guarantee is machine-checked by `scripts/check_local_truth.py`; this picture is the half a human
has to judge.

### The replay verifier

![replay verifier showing a green Verified OK banner reading 5 of 5 committed turns re-hash](docs/assets/replay-verified-ok.png)

*Same game's `log_` artifact, `--step-ms 400`.*

`Verified OK`, **5/5 committed turns re-hash**, with the commit-reveal chain for the stepped turn
beside it — `h_commit`, the commit sent and acknowledged, the commit received, and the reveal.
Every hash is recomputed from the artifact alone; the verifier reproduces this with the wire log
and the nonce ledger deleted from disk. The banner has three states and the other two are reachable
and tested: a tampered artifact reads `FAILED` naming the offending turn, and a zero-turn artifact
reads `Nothing to verify` rather than a vacuous pass.

## Configuration guide

Every number the agents use is read from JSON under `config/<role>/`, never hardcoded. Each
file carries a `_sources` block citing the document each leaf came from, because JSON has no
comment syntax and an uncited number is indistinguishable from an invented one.

| File | Governs |
|---|---|
| `game_params.json` | Board size, start cells, movement, barrier quota, move ceiling, the scoring table. **Fixed values** — a deviation disqualifies. |
| `role.json` · `network.json` | Which seat this is; listen host/port and the opponent's URL. |
| `strategy.json` · `weights.json` | The brain class per seat, and the 15-weight evaluation vector. |
| `belief.json` · `scent.json` | Bayesian belief priors; the 5×5 emission kernel and decay law (both **fixed**). |
| `language.json` · `deception.json` | LLM provider, gatekeeper limits, hint word ceiling, the truth/lie policy. |
| `security.json` | Commit-reveal on/off, hash and nonce policy, Step-0 declaration fields. |
| `resolution.json` | The negotiated rules block: which optional predicates this seat proposes. |
| `tunnel.json` | Tunnel provider and the **names** of the environment variables holding its secrets. |
| `reporting.json` | Mail mode (`dry_run` in everything shipped), the mandatory recipient, artifact directory, and the gatekeeper's rate limits. |
| `league.json` | Rule 49's four repo URLs, the MCP server addresses and the agreed token ceiling. |
| `games_played.json` | The raw mechanical counter. Not a declaration. |

Rules that hold across all of them: no secret is ever a config value, only the *name* of an
environment variable; the two roles' `game_params.json` and `scent.json` must be identical
and are compared by cryptographic digest during the handshake; and values marked **fixed** in
`docs/PARAMETERS.md` may never be edited, while **minimum** values may only move upward.

---

## The model — a Dec-POMDP

The match is a **decentralised, partially observable Markov game**. Two agents act
simultaneously on a shared state that neither observes directly, and neither may condition
its action on the other's action for the same turn.

- **State** `s = (cop cell, thief cell, barrier set, turn index, barriers remaining)` on the
  7×7 grid. Transitions are deterministic given the joint action.
- **Actions** are enumerated from the *same* pre-turn state for both seats: five moves
  (four orthogonal plus stay) for either agent, and for the cop optionally a barrier
  placement — only the cop may place one, and placing it on the thief's cell is a capture.
- **Observations** are strictly local. A seat sees its own cell, the barriers it knows
  about, the scent field it maintains, and the opponent's free-text hint — which may be a
  lie. A seat never receives the opponent's coordinates: `shared/hint_guard.py` refuses to
  *send* a digit pair or a row/column phrase.
- **Uncertainty** is carried as an explicit belief distribution over the opponent's cell,
  updated by Bayes from two likelihoods — scent intensity and the decoded hint — in
  `strategy/belief.py` and `strategy/belief_hint.py`. It is the only thing the agent has, and
  it is what the live GUI renders.
- **Rewards** are the book's scoring table, taken from `docs/PARAMETERS.md` and never
  invented: capture 20/5, survival 5/10, tie 2/2, technical loss 0/0, cop first.
- **Why it is not an MDP.** Book §5.3.2 p.35 states that the Acknowledge phase *"guarantees
  that the reveal will occur only when both sides have already fixed their moves"*. That
  makes the per-turn problem a matrix game, in which a deterministic best response does not
  exist and the only unexploitable play at contact squares is a mixed one. The consequence
  for the algorithm is in the next-but-one section.

Fuller treatment: [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md), [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md),
[`docs/phases/phase-3/PRD.md`](docs/phases/phase-3/PRD.md).

## Orchestration dilemmas

**Turn management under simultaneity.** Both seats must fix their actions before either sees
the other's. A four-phase protocol enforces it — **Commit** (a hash only) → **Acknowledge**
→ **Reveal** (move and hint; the nonce stays hidden) → **Final Reveal / Audit** (all nonces
at game end). The turn resolves *once*, from one joint resolver, so no seat can act on
information from the same turn. Phase 3's post-mortem records what happened before this was
true: the engine resolved cop-then-thief and the thief was effectively choosing with sight
of the cop's new cell.

**Network failure handling.** Every remote call is bounded and every bound is observable. A
freeze watchdog `os._exit`s an agent that stops making progress, rather than hanging a peer
that is waiting on it. An early or out-of-order envelope is **buffered**, never eaten —
discarding a peer's early `FINAL_REVEAL` once created a path to a false accusation of
silence, and that class is now held closed by a guard enumerated over all twelve queue-pull
sites. A dropped tunnel mid-round is on the record too, in `GATE-5-MEASUREMENT.md` attempt 2.

**The Gatekeeper.** One component fronts every external call — language model and mail alike.
Its limits come from config, never from constants in code, and on overflow it **queues and
refuses; it never crashes** (rules 28–29). Contract:
[`docs/PRD_gatekeeper.md`](docs/PRD_gatekeeper.md).

**The Orchestrator.** There isn't one, and that is the design. Each peer is simultaneously a
server and a client; no process arbitrates the game; and the only "launcher" holds no state
and passes no data between the two children. Anything else would be a referee, and a referee
is disqualifying.

---

## The strategy that ships

**Per turn, in four steps** — no language model is on this path at any point:

1. Enumerate both action sets from the same pre-turn state (`sdk/actions.py`).
2. Build the |A_cop| × |A_thief| payoff matrix by one-ply expansion through the *live*
   negotiated rules (`strategy/matrix.py`): `M[i][j]` is the value of the resolved successor.
3. Solve the matrix game (`strategy/equilibrium.py`): a pure saddle point when one exists,
   otherwise regret matching — a **mixed** strategy.
4. Sample this seat's action from a seeded, logged RNG (`strategy/valuebrain.py`).

Leaf values are bounded to `[-1, 1]`: capture `+1.0`, survival `-1.0`, and every
non-terminal position `tanh(w · φ(s))` over a **15-feature** evaluation of the free-cell
graph — distance, reachability, degree, territory, cycle rank, chokepoints, barrier and turn
budgets, parity. The game is zero-sum, so one weight vector serves both seats by negation.

Nothing joint is ever stored: the matrix is rebuilt at the point of use, and only the 15
floats are learned. A decision costs **3.62 ms** cold and 2.14 ms warm, against a negotiated
30-second timeout.

**What was withdrawn, and why it matters here.** Run 1 of this project trained a tabular
Q-learning policy for 300,000 episodes; it was **superseded** and withdrawn, and
[`docs/PRD_rl_strategy.md`](docs/PRD_rl_strategy.md) still carries the ⛔ banner saying so.
The reason is the one above: `max_a' Q(s', a')` is a single-agent quantity with no meaning in
a simultaneous game, and `argmax` over a Q-row is deterministic by construction — this
repository measured a search cop capturing a *deterministic* evader 96% of the time and a
*mixing* one 36%. Earlier revisions of this README described the withdrawn design as what
ships. It did not, and it does not.

Mechanism contract: [`docs/PRD_matrix_mover.md`](docs/PRD_matrix_mover.md). The full history,
including the reversals: [`ENGINEERING-LOG.md`](docs/phases/phase-3/ENGINEERING-LOG.md) and
[`RUN-1-POSTMORTEM.md`](docs/phases/phase-3/RUN-1-POSTMORTEM.md).

## Learning curves

Rule 42 and §9.4.2 item 4 make learning curves a graded section. **These are the curves of
the mechanism that ships**, drawn from tracked artefacts, reproducible on a clean checkout
with no training run and no API key:

```bash
uv run python scripts/plot_run2_curves.py
```

**Outcome regression — the optimiser whose vector ships.** 40 generations × 600 games ≈
24,000 games, `seed=1337`, Adagrad on `tanh(w·φ)` against each game's actual result, scored
every generation against *fixed* anchors rather than against self-play — a policy that has
merely learned to beat its own past selves otherwise looks like progress.

![run 2 outcome-regression learning curve](artifacts/curves/run2_selfplay.png)

Cop capture rate against the anchors rises 0.523 → 0.737 and thief survival 0.280 → 0.363,
while the regression loss falls 1.634 → 0.724. The vector at the end of this run is
byte-identical to the shipped `config/police/weights.json` and `config/thief/weights.json`.

**(1+λ)-ES on league points — run to completion, and NOT shipped.**

![run 2 evolution-strategy fitness curve](artifacts/curves/run2_evolution.png)

Best-so-far fitness rises 32.67 → 35.50. Total points came out near-identical to outcome
regression; the *distribution* did not. Held out at n=200 with 95% Wilson intervals:

| Optimiser | thief vs sealing cop | thief vs blind cop | cop vs evader |
|---|---|---|---|
| hand-set prior | 43.5% | 14.5% | 100% |
| **outcome regression (ships)** | **58.0%** | **32.5%** | **100%** |
| (1+λ)-ES | 20.0% | 85.5% | 93.5% |

The ES vector is a specialist that collapses against the stronger and more likely archetype
— a competent opponent uses its barrier quota, and rule 46 makes that decisive — so the
balanced vector ships and the ES run is kept as a **documented negative result** rather than
deleted. Training also flipped the sign of two features the hand-set prior had backwards
(`chokepoint_density` +0.40 → −0.49, `thief_on_chokepoint` +0.30 → −0.39).

**The run-1 figures are still in the tree** (`artifacts/curves/winrate_cop.png`,
`winrate_thief.png`, `mean_reward.png`, and the raw `curves.csv`). They are retained as the
evidence of a **withdrawn** design, not as a description of this product, and the CLI that
drew them was removed with the rest of that stack. Their story — a gate that failed and was
reported failing rather than lowered — is in
[`RUN-1-POSTMORTEM.md`](docs/phases/phase-3/RUN-1-POSTMORTEM.md).

## Security model

| Property | How it is obtained |
|---|---|
| A move cannot be changed after seeing the opponent's | Four-phase commit-reveal. The hash input is canonical JSON (`sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":")`), so both peers hash byte-identical input. |
| The commitment cannot be brute-forced | A 16-byte nonce from `secrets.token_hex(16)` — never `random` — kept hidden until the Final Reveal. |
| A forged or withheld reveal is caught | The end-of-game mutual audit re-derives every commitment from the nonces and records a durable `audit_verdict`. Its join key is derived locally, not taken from the peer. |
| Both sides agreed the same rules and numbers | A Step-0 declaration carrying identity, hardware, model, code version and **commit hash** (rule 53), cross-signed and compared with `secrets.compare_digest`; the game parameters and scent kernel are compared by digest during the handshake. |
| The GUI cannot leak the truth | The local-truth firewall — a CI gate that walks the AST of every `gui/`-reachable module (rules 8–9). |
| No secret is in the repository | `os.environ.get()` only; `.env-example` carries dummy values; credential filenames are in `.gitignore` (rules 39–40). |

Evidence: [`GATE-6-MEASUREMENT.md`](docs/phases/phase-6/GATE-6-MEASUREMENT.md) (all three
criteria PASS, including a tamper harness and a live Step-0 mismatch) and
[`docs/PRD_commit_reveal.md`](docs/PRD_commit_reveal.md).

## Quality gates

Segal §19.1 Table 5 is enforced, not aspired to. Every command below runs offline.

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=pursuit --cov=training   # tests + coverage (floor 85%)
uv run ruff check .                          # lint (0 violations required)
bash scripts/check_line_limit.sh             # every file <= 150 code lines
uv run python scripts/check_local_truth.py   # rules 8-9 firewall
uv run python scripts/check_no_llm_in_strategy.py  # rule 25 firewall
uv run python scripts/check_submission.py    # 86 submission rows, re-derived
uv lock --check                              # the lockfile is current
```

Measured 2026-08-17: **2366 passed, 0 failed**, coverage **97.44%**, ruff **0** violations,
line-limit **0** violations, local-truth firewall OK over 7 modules, rule-25 firewall OK.
Every one of those numbers is reproducible by running the commands above — they are quoted
here so a stale claim can be caught, not so they can be taken on trust. The same jobs run in CI
([`.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml`](.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml)) and the
150-line check additionally runs as a pre-commit hook.

`scripts/check_submission.py` is deliberately the one gate that **fails**: it re-derives 86
submission requirements from the tree on every run and exits 1 while any remains open, so
the open ones cannot be forgotten. Its verdicts are narrated in
[`docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md`](docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md).

## Companion repository

Rule 49 requires the cop and the thief to be published as **two separate repositories**, each
README linking to the other.

| Agent | Repository |
|---|---|
| **Cop** (police) | https://github.com/khaledmanaa11/pursuit-police |
| **Thief** | https://github.com/khaledmanaa11/pursuit-thief |

Both are built from this development repository by `scripts/build_split_repos.py`, which runs
`uv sync`, `ruff check`, `pytest --cov` and the 150-line scan **inside each output** before it
reports success. Each carries the annotated tag **`v1.00`**, whose name is derived from
`src/pursuit/shared/version.py` rather than chosen.

**Each carries this repository's full commit history** — 577 commits, plus one import
commit that injects this banner and the provenance file. `docs/SEGAL_GUIDELINES.md`
§17 grades *orderly Git history*, and it is judged on the repository handed in, so a
submission built as one squashed commit would hide the record it is graded on. The
build verifies the depth rather than assuming it: the commit count must equal this
repository's own count **plus exactly one**, so a truncated or shallow clone fails the
build instead of shipping as orderly with holes in it.

Earlier builds produced one commit per output, with histories deliberately disjoint
from this one — a choice made while this repository was private, so that no reflex
`git push` could publish working history. That premise is gone: this repository is
public, so the history is already published, and the clone that carries it removes the
inherited remote before the build returns.

The same two links are recorded in `config/<role>/league.json` under `league.repo_urls`. The
remaining two slots there -- `opponent_cop` and `opponent_thief` -- stay `null` until an
opponent supplies them on league day, and `load_league_config` refuses `live` reporting while
any slot is empty, so a scored game cannot begin with rule 49 half-satisfied.

| Document | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`docs/RULES.md`](docs/RULES.md) · [`docs/PARAMETERS.md`](docs/PARAMETERS.md) | The game and protocol rules, and every numeric value with its fixed/minimum/negotiable status — both extracted from the course book |
| [`docs/SEGAL_GUIDELINES.md`](docs/SEGAL_GUIDELINES.md) | The engineering standard this repository is graded against |
| [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md) · [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) · [`docs/TODO.md`](docs/TODO.md) | Project-level requirements, design and task tracking |
| `docs/PRD_<mechanism>.md` | One PRD per algorithm or central mechanism (§2.3) — the matrix mover, commit-reveal, the belief map, the scent map, deception, the MCP transport, the gatekeeper, the log/result artifacts, the display belief |
| [`docs/PRD_rl_strategy.md`](docs/PRD_rl_strategy.md) | **Superseded** — the withdrawn run-1 design, retained under a banner because deleting a reversal hides it |
| [`docs/phases/`](docs/phases/) | A PRD/PLAN/TODO triplet per phase, plus each phase's `GATE-N-MEASUREMENT.md` |
| [`docs/STRATEGY.md`](docs/STRATEGY.md) · [`docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`](docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md) | Strategy design notes and project orientation |

## Contributing

This is a university final project, built solo, published so it can be read, run and graded.
Pull requests are not expected — but every gate above is reproducible by anyone who clones
it, which is the point.

The working standard, the setup steps, the commit conventions and the review checklist are
in **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**. The two rules worth repeating here: `uv` is
mandatory, and a file over 150 code lines is **split, never compressed** — the pre-commit
hook enforces it and `--no-verify` is not an option.

## Licence

This project is released under the **MIT Licence** — see **[LICENSE](LICENSE)**.

The licence was drafted by an earlier plan and deliberately held unadopted behind a
`PREPARED, NOT ADOPTED` block, because choosing one is a legal declaration about the
owner's own coursework. **The owner adopted MIT on 2026-08-19** and the block was removed;
`OQ8-5` is closed in
[`docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md`](docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md), which records what the
confirmation covered. `pyproject.toml` points at the file rather than declaring an SPDX
string, so the licence text itself stays the single source.
