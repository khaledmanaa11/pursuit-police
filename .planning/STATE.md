gsd_state_version: 1.0
milestone: v1.0
milestone_name: milestone
status: executing
Resume file: None -- 08-11 is committed and closed, and it was the LAST UNATTENDED PLAN OF THE
  PROJECT. The tree is clean apart from the untracked throwaway `game_artifacts/`, which must
  NEVER be committed (D7-19). **WAVE 4 IS COMPLETE. EVERYTHING THAT REMAINS IS A HUMAN'S:**
  08-12 (publish), 08-13 (league games, also needs 07-10), 08-14 (submit).
  WHAT 08-12 INHERITS, WRITTEN DOWN RATHER THAN REMEMBERED: two split repositories at
  `C:\Users\Hp\pursuit-split-repos\pursuit-police` (`daa16a7`) and `...\pursuit-thief`
  (`b0cb27b`), rebuilt from source commit `99a8959`, **12/12 rows each**, **1046 tracked files
  each**, **ZERO REMOTES**, one commit apiece, histories disjoint from this repository, and each
  carrying an **annotated tag `v1.00`** on its own HEAD -- **NOT PUSHED**. Tag tree file count
  1046 = `git ls-files` in both. `git tag -l` IN THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL EMPTY, DELIBERATELY.
  THE TAG NAME IS DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN (D-79): `v` + `src/pursuit/shared/version.py` `VERSION`.
  T5-06 IS CLOSED -- `pyproject.toml` moved `1.00.0` -> `1.00` and now NAMES `version.py` as the
  source it copies; `tests/unit/test_version_single_source.py` compares RAW STRINGS, never
  PEP-440 versions, because `1.00` and `1.0` are the same version and two different tag names.
  Proven to fail three ways (`1.0` -> 1 failed; drifted `VERSION` -> 3 failed; drifted config
  JSON -> 1 failed), each mutation asserted landed before the run and reverted after.
  TWO REASONS THE TAG IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY, one decided and one MEASURED: D-79 puts it on
  the submitted artifact, and an external process pushes this repository's `origin/main`
  unbidden (observed 2026-08-14 and 2026-08-16, no git hook responsible), so a local tag here
  could be swept outward by something nobody in the session controls. Written into
  `GATE-8-MEASUREMENT.md` and the `G6-08` checklist row, not only into a summary.
  **GATE-8 IS NOT MET AND THE RECORD SAYS SO IN ITS FIRST LINE.** Three criteria, six halves,
  THREE PENDING with a named owner each: criterion 1 `BUILT+TAGGED PASS; PUBLISHED PENDING
  (08-12)`; criterion 2 `README PASS; SCREENSHOTS PENDING (07-10); FORM+SUBMISSION PENDING
  (08-14)`; criterion 3 `MACHINERY PASS; GAMES PENDING (08-13, needs 07-10)`.
  `scripts/measure_gate8.py` exits 0 -- and the document states that exit 0 means "everything
  that could be true before a human acts is true", NEVER "GATE-8 is met".
  THREE RUNBOOKS EXIST AND EVERY BACKTICKED PATH IN THEM RESOLVES AGAINST `git ls-files`:
  `PUBLISH-RUNBOOK.md` (08-12), `LEAGUE-RUNBOOK.md` (08-13), `SUBMISSION-RUNBOOK.md` (08-14).
  Each states in its OWN text that no agent may enter credentials, click consent, create a
  repository or send mail. The citation check found three paths cited as though they shipped --
  both gitignored `games_played.json` counters and the not-yet-written league ledger -- now
  exempted BY NAME with a test that refuses an exemption for anything actually tracked.
  THE 89%->1% CORRECTION IS DONE, IN ALL FOUR SITES: the reproducible pair is **32.0% -> 7.5%**,
  measured by `scripts/sensitivity_reconcile.py`. **The DIRECTION of the shipped decision is
  confirmed and unchanged** (declining the swap is still worth ~25 points of thief survival, and
  the cop seat still converts 100% either way); only the MAGNITUDE moves, and **THE CAUSE WAS
  NEVER ESTABLISHED**. Append-with-correction, not overwrite: Act 4.3's table body is left
  intact beneath its correction because `sensitivity_reconcile.py` PARSES that table for the
  claim it re-measures -- overwriting it would have broken the script that found the problem.
  A TRAP WORTH NOT REDISCOVERING: **`build_split_repos.py --replace` recreates both `.git`
  directories and therefore DESTROYS THE TAGS.** Re-cut after every rebuild;
  `PUBLISH-RUNBOOK.md` step 2 says so. This plan hit it once -- its first build produced tags at
  police `4897b48` / thief `18d904c`, both now unreachable, and both figures are recorded in
  `GATE-8-MEASUREMENT.md` rather than one silently replacing the other.
  SIX DEVIATIONS, EVERY ONE A DEFECT IN THIS PLAN'S OWN WORK found by running it: a 2000-char
  banner slice read a URL out of the README body; the declaration call site was sought in the
  wrong module (criterion 3 read FAIL for a mechanism that works); the commit hash is NESTED at
  `declarations.own.declaration.commit_hash`, not top level; the screenshot scan globbed a
  `docs/assets/` that does not exist and reported 0 tracked images where the audit gate reports
  5; the no-remote-verb scanner flagged its own constant; and the overall-PASS regex flagged the
  GATE-8 record's own HONEST header -- a check impossible to satisfy honestly, the mirror image
  of a check impossible to fail.
  `check_submission.py` re-run at HEAD: **70 PASS / 3 GAP / 13 UNJUDGED**, exit 1 -- ONE row
  moved (T5-06), exactly the one this plan owned, and no other row moved in either direction.
  The three remaining GAPs: G1-03b and G5-04 (screenshots, **07-10's**, MARKED-ABSENT SLOTS and
  not to be faked) and G6-08 (the tag -- **GAP here by design, PASS inside the split outputs**,
  where the same gate returns 71 PASS / 2 GAP).
  STILL OPEN AND STILL A HUMAN'S: OQ8-1 (D7-17, DRAFTED and UNSENT), OQ8-2 (the games-played
  VALUE), OQ8-3 (where the form lives), OQ8-4 (the self-assessment SCORE -- the field in
  `docs/SELF-ASSESSMENT.md` is BLANK and a test fails the moment a digit appears), OQ8-5 (**THE
  LICENCE -- still `AWAITING_OWNER_CONFIRMATION`; DO NOT PUBLISH UNTIL THE OWNER CONFIRMS**),
  OQ8-6 (the two repo URLs), OQ8-7 (the token ceiling), OQ8-8 (README language), OQ8-9 (is
  `origin` public? -- FIRST ITEM OF 08-12 AND STILL UNANSWERED).
  THIS AGENT PUSHED NOTHING, CREATED NO REPOSITORY, ADDED NO REMOTE, CUT NO TAG IN THIS
  REPOSITORY and issued NO remote or `gh` command of any kind.
  ONE THING RECORDED RATHER THAN FORCED: `uv.lock` still carries the project version as the
  PEP-440-normalised `1.0.0` and `uv lock` does not rewrite it; `uv lock --check` exits 0. That
  is a second reason the version pin compares `pyproject.toml` against `version.py` rather than
  dragging in a file whose value a tool normalises.

## CURRENT STATUS — 2026-08-20, and it supersedes the narrative below

**Everything from here down is the 2026-08-17 session record**, written when 08-11 closed and
08-12/13/14 were all still pending. It is kept as a record, not as a status. Where it and this
block disagree, **this block is current** — five of its statements have since been overtaken:

| The record below says | What is true now |
|---|---|
| the licence is `AWAITING_OWNER_CONFIRMATION` — **"DO NOT PUBLISH UNTIL THE OWNER CONFIRMS"** | **MIT, adopted by the owner on 2026-08-19.** `LICENSE` no longer carries its `PREPARED, NOT ADOPTED` block and `docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` reads `CONFIRMED_BY_THE_OWNER`. OQ8-5 is **closed** |
| OQ8-9 (is `origin` public?) is unanswered | **Answered: `origin` is PUBLIC.** A scan of the full history found no provider-key shape and no credential file ever committed |
| the four rule-49 repo URLs are all `null` | **Our two are recorded** in `config/*/league.json` and in both READMEs. The opponent's two stay `null` until league day, and the loader still refuses live mode while any slot is empty |
| the split outputs are `daa16a7` / `b0cb27b` from `99a8959`, 1046 files, one commit each | **Rebuilt with full history (D-83)**: 1070 files, **580 commits each**, annotated `v1.00` on HEAD, 24/24 gate rows, published to the two public repositories |
| 08-12 is pending and blocked | **08-12 is complete.** Both repositories are created, pushed and tagged |

**Still open, and all three are a human's:**

- **08-13** — the two scored league games. Needs an opponent; nothing in the code blocks it.
- **08-14** — the submission form. Needs three values only the owner can set: where the form
  lives (OQ8-3), the self-assessment score (OQ8-4, blank and pinned blank), and the
  games-played VALUE (OQ8-2 — rule 38 makes a false figure an absolute disqualification, so
  nothing here may choose it; evidence in `docs/phases/phase-7/GAMES-PLAYED-RECONSTRUCTION.md`).
- **D7-17** — drafted and still unsent, at
  `docs/phases/phase-8/D7-17-QUESTION-FOR-THE-LECTURER.md`.

**07-10 is proven but not spent.** The live Gmail path was exercised end to end on 2026-08-19 —
OAuth consent, send-only scope, real transport, JSON attached — delivered to the owner's own
inbox via `scripts/live_send.py --recipient`. The send to the mandatory grading address happens
once, on league day, carrying a real game report.


Last session: 2026-08-17T23:30:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 08-11 in full -- **THE LAST UNATTENDED PLAN OF THE PROJECT.** No plan file
  existed; executed from `08-PLAN-OUTLINE.md` Sec9, the same way 08-03 .. 08-10 were. **ELEVEN
  ATOMIC COMMITS** (`f34236f` .. `8a421a4`), three of them TDD RED tests committed before their
  fix. **The run was interrupted by a server-side 529 and resumed by re-reading the tree**: the
  eight already-committed commits were VERIFIED ON DISK rather than redone, and the uncommitted
  `split_build_evidence.json` was inspected for half-writes before being trusted (it was
  complete -- both repositories, `verdict: pass`, `source_commit: 99a8959`).
  DELIVERED: annotated **`v1.00`** in BOTH split outputs (police `daa16a7`, thief `b0cb27b`),
  verified annotated / on HEAD / tree file count 1046 = `git ls-files` / zero remotes, and
  **NOT PUSHED**; `docs/phases/phase-8/GATE-8-MEASUREMENT.md` opening "GATE-8 IS NOT MET" with
  three of six halves PENDING; `scripts/measure_gate8.py` + four siblings with the gate7 exit
  contract (0/1/2) and 15 contract tests; three human-run runbooks; `docs/SELF-ASSESSMENT.md`
  with the score field BLANK and pinned blank; T5-06 closed; and the unreproducible `89% -> 1%`
  pair corrected to `32.0% -> 7.5%` in all four artifacts that ship it.
  INSIDE THE TAGGED TREE, CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: `pyproject.toml` reads `version = "1.00"`,
  `resolution.py` and `phase-3/PRD.md` carry the corrected pair, all five of this plan's
  documents are present, and each of the SEVEN forbidden names was checked EXACTLY and is
  absent. (A substring grep returns 2 hits, both test MODULES named after the counter -- which
  is why the check is an exact match on seven names and not a grep.)
  GATES: `uv run pytest --cov` **2583 passed / 0 failed at 97.44%**; inside each split output
  **2582 passed / 0 failed at 97.44%** -- the one-test difference is
  `test_research_docs.py::test_every_cited_commit_hash_resolves`, which SKIPS BY DESIGN in a
  split tree (verified there: 12 passed / 1 skipped), exactly as 08-09 predicted. `ruff check .`
  0; line-limit exit 0 with **545 tracked `.py` files scanned, 0 violations** in each output;
  split build **12/12 rows in each**, driver exit 0; `measure_gate8.py` exit 0 run twice;
  `uv lock --check` exit 0.
  RULE-38 COUNTERS: suite **1927->1927 / 1920->1920 (0/0)**, `git diff config/` empty.
  **NO REAL GAME WAS PLAYED BY 08-11** -- it delivers a tag, three runbooks and two documents,
  none of which needs one. The +1/+1 contract is INHERITED from 07-09/08-07/08-08 and recorded
  as inherited, never claimed as measured here -- the same refusal 08-09 and 08-10 made.
  Knowledge graph refreshed: 12410 nodes, 21398 edges, 680 communities.
  SELF-CHECK PASSED: 28 of 28 `key-files` paths exist AND are tracked; 12 of 12 in-repository
  commit hashes resolve; `daa16a7` and `b0cb27b` resolve in their OWN repositories and in
  neither case in this one (the disjoint-history property, asserted rather than assumed).
  NOTHING WAS PUSHED, NO REPOSITORY CREATED, NO REMOTE ADDED, NO TAG CUT IN THIS REPOSITORY,
  AND NO REMOTE OR `gh` COMMAND OF ANY KIND ISSUED.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 08-11 is closed. **There is no next unattended plan.**
  Next is `/gsd:verify-work 8`, and then the three human-gated plans in order: 08-12 (publish --
  BLOCKED on OQ8-9 and on OQ8-5, the licence, which is still AWAITING_OWNER_CONFIRMATION),
  08-13 (league games, also needs 07-10) and 08-14 (submit). 08-12 should REBUILD the two
  outputs first and RE-CUT the tag afterwards -- `--replace` destroys tags -- both of which are
  step 1 and step 2 of `docs/phases/phase-8/PUBLISH-RUNBOOK.md`.
Last session: 2026-08-17T22:40:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 08-10 in full -- the two-repo split, built and verified LOCALLY, nothing
  pushed. Twenty-one atomic commits (`d4d2284` .. `3f37b66`), seven of them TDD RED tests
  committed before their implementation. `pursuit-police` (`99d6d5f`) and `pursuit-thief`
  (`580acae`) under `C:\Users\Hp\pursuit-split-repos\`, built from `git ls-files` at
  `8aa02ea` into a destination OUTSIDE this tree, **12/12 rows each**: ruff 0, `uv sync` 0,
  **2533 passed / 0 failed at 97.44%** inside each output, line-limit **539 scanned / 0
  violations**, one commit, zero remotes, histories disjoint from this repository.
  D-77 verified by RUNNING the gates: both seats' config in both outputs (14 files each), zero
  counters. The planted untracked `secret.txt`, `.env` and the book PDF proven absent from both.
  Both rule-49 URLs written as stated-absent markers, with a test asserting the banner carries no
  URL shape at all.
  **THE SPLIT FOUND FOUR TESTS THAT ASSERTED THE DEVELOPER'S TREE** and therefore failed on any
  fresh clone -- worst of them, the rule-38 README leak detector, which searched an EMPTY value
  set in every clone and so guarded nothing. All four fixed with mutation probes; this plan's own
  first fix for one of them was itself vacuous and the probe caught it.
  Counters: suite 1927->1927 / 1920->1920 (0/0). NO real game was played; the +1/+1 contract is
  recorded as INHERITED. `check_submission.py` 69/4/13 UNCHANGED -- the counter-control. Graph
  refreshed (12199 nodes). One deferred item logged (a load-sensitive timing test, out of scope,
  no config value touched). Nothing pushed, no repository created, no remote added, no tag, no
  remote command of any kind. **Wave 3 is complete; next is 08-11.**
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 08-10 is closed. 08-11 should REBUILD the two outputs
  before cutting its tag (D-79 tags the OUTPUTS, never this repository): they are one commit
  stale by construction, and the rebuild is one idempotent command in
  `docs/phases/phase-8/SPLIT-RUNBOOK.md`. The tag name is DERIVED from the reconciled
  `version.py` / `pyproject.toml` pair (T5-06 is still a GAP and is 08-11's).
---

Last session: 2026-08-17T23:59:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 08-09 in full -- the four Sec17 research artifacts the repository had
  none of. Seven atomic commits (`32440b4`, `486a01a`, `a8931b7`, `bcce41b`, `32535b7`,
  `112bd6f`, `aac4cf8`). `docs/SENSITIVITY.md`, `docs/TOKEN-COST.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LOG.md` and
  `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` -- the repository's FIRST tracked notebook, executing offline with
  three committed figures. `check_submission.py` 65/8/13 -> **69 PASS / 4 GAP / 13 UNJUDGED**,
  exactly the four rows this plan owns, no other row moving in either direction.
  EVERY PUBLISHED NUMBER IS RENDERED FROM A COMMITTED ARTIFACT and re-rendered by
  `tests/unit/test_research_docs.py` for comparison, so a hand-edited figure fails the suite.
  The sweep varies ONLY parameters `docs/PARAMETERS.md` marks `minimum` (upward) or
  `negotiable`, plus three labelled engineering defaults -- and that is a PARSE of the Status
  column, not a promise. Separable at 95% Wilson: board 11 +35.0pp, horizon 70 -29.0pp,
  swap-as-capture -25.0pp, the fitted vector +18.0pp; search depth and extra barriers move
  nothing separably, and the saturated cop matchup is flagged rather than read as evidence.
  TWO HONEST FINDINGS KEPT RATHER THAN SMOOTHED: the sweep contradicts ENGINEERING-LOG Act
  4.3's 89%/1% pair (measured 32.0%/7.5%, eight arms re-measured, CAUSE NOT ESTABLISHED, the
  shipped decision's direction unchanged), and three vacuities were found in this plan's OWN
  tests by probing -- two parametrizations that iterated an empty set, a disjunct whose trivial
  branch was the one being taken, and a fixture that failed on ZeroDivisionError rather than its
  assertion. All fixed, all probed RED, all reverted.
  Counters: suite 1927->1927 / 1920->1920 (0/0). NO real game was played -- 08-09 delivers
  documents, and the +1/+1 contract is recorded as INHERITED from 08-07/08-08, never claimed as
  measured here. Suite 2455 passed, coverage 97.44% unchanged, ruff 0, line-limit 0. Nothing
  pushed, no tag, no remote command of any kind. **Wave 2 is complete; next is 08-10.**


Last session: 2026-08-17T19:45:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 08-07 and 08-08 in full. Four atomic commits (`acc5913`, `072d61d`,
  `5687c39`, `f176923`). The repository's FIRST six rendered mermaid diagrams -- C4 x4, a
  deployment view and the four-phase commit-reveal sequence -- with symmetric peers, rule-2
  process separation and D-76's separate GUI process asserted about the DRAWN GRAPH rather than
  captioned. Plus `docs/QUALITY-25010.md` (eight characteristics, each with its own repo
  evidence, against a repo that held ONE line on 25010), `docs/EXTENSION-POINTS.md` (five real
  seams), `docs/PRD_sdk.md` and `docs/PRD_tunnel.md`. `check_submission.py` 58/15/13 ->
  **65 PASS / 8 GAP / 13 UNJUDGED**, exactly the seven rows these two plans own, no other row
  moving in either direction. New assertions proven RED on the pre-change documents: 16 failed /
  4 passed, then 5 failed / 6 passed. Rendering proven with the REAL renderer out of tree, and
  the two mutations the unit tests use were rejected by it. Six deviations, five of them defects
  in this session's own work found before commit -- including TWO cited script names that do not
  exist, one of them the 08 outline's PREDICTED filename rather than the tree's. Counters: suite
  0/0, one real game +1/+1, `game_id` `2582a94c8a5ec618`, both seats matched=true.
  NOTHING PUSHED BY THIS AGENT -- but `origin/main` moved to `acc5913` SIX MINUTES after that
  commit, with no pushing hook in this repository and `codex.exe` running. Investigate.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and both plans are closed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 8`
  finishing wave 2 with 08-09 (sensitivity analysis, offline notebook, token-cost analysis,
  prompt log -- the last four GAPs Claude can close), then wave 3's 08-10. Any document 08-09
  writes under `docs/` is subject to the backticked-path rule if it is one of the six
  contract-covered files, and any mermaid it adds must carry an `<!-- diagram: NAME -->` marker
  and pass `scripts/check_diagrams.py`.
---

Last session: 2026-08-17T23:20:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 08-06 in full -- the root README rebuilt to Sec2.1's seven items AND
  Sec9.4.2's six sections, with the rule-42 honesty defect closed. Four atomic commits
  (`26bd9d8`, `129fa7f`, `a5fc8c5`, `6141b61`). Interrupted mid-plan by a 529 and resumed by
  re-reading the tree rather than trusting it. `check_submission.py` 49/24/13 -> 58/15/13,
  exactly the nine rows this plan owns. New assertions proven RED on the pre-fix file: 6 failed
  / 11 passed against `git show HEAD:README.md`, restored byte-identically afterwards. Six
  deviations, four of them defects in this plan's own work found before commit -- including a
  GATE PASS THAT WAS FRAGILE RATHER THAN WRONG (a `#` comment inside a bash fence parses as a
  heading, leaving G1-02's body at exactly the 3-line floor). Counters: suite 0/0, one real game
  +1/+1, `game_id` `47873d48ba712222`, both seats matched=true.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 08-06 is closed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 8`
  continuing wave 2: 08-07 (architecture docs), 08-08 (the three per-mechanism PRDs) and 08-09
  (research and visualization). None of them shares a file with 08-06, but all three must keep
  `tests/unit/test_readme_contract.py` green if they touch README.md.
---


Last session: 2026-08-17T16:40:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 08-03 and 08-05 in full -- WAVE 1 OF PHASE 8 IS CLOSED. Neither plan file
  existed; both executed from `08-PLAN-OUTLINE.md` Sec9. Eleven atomic commits (7 + 4).
  08-03 moved `check_submission.py` from 41 PASS / 32 GAP / 13 UNJUDGED to 49 / 24 / 13 -- eight
  rows, exactly the eight it owned, no other row moving in either direction. 08-05 CLOSED both
  phase-5 deferred items rather than accepting them, and proved the shipped commit-reveal-ON path
  byte-identical with a nonce-pinned fingerprint (same h_commit, same push turns, same ledger
  record) so the D-59 hash input and the D-64 join key are demonstrably untouched.
  THE LICENCE IS PREPARED AND NOT ADOPTED, and that is enforced rather than merely written:
  `LICENSE` carries a `PREPARED, NOT ADOPTED` block, `docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` carries
  `**LICENCE STATUS:** AWAITING_OWNER_CONFIRMATION`, and a biconditional test fails if either
  changes without the other. 08-12 must not publish until the owner confirms.
  Three self-inflicted test defects were found by this session's own probes and closed before
  commit, and one INHERITED bookmark (05-18's, written to fail on #19's closure) was found NOT to
  fire and was repaired. Self-check PASSED for both plans: 13 created paths verified present AND
  tracked AND not gitignored, 11 commits verified reachable.
  NOTHING PUSHED, NO TAG CREATED, NO REMOTE TOUCHED -- `git tag -l` is empty and 144 commits sit
  ahead of `origin/main`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean apart from untracked throwaway `game_artifacts/`, which
  must never be committed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 8` continuing into WAVE 2: 08-06, 08-07,
  08-08 and 08-09, a four-way fan-out over disjoint document sets (worktrees if run in parallel).
---


Last session: 2026-08-17T21:05:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 08-04 in full. NO `08-04-PLAN.md` EXISTED -- the phase directory holds only
  `08-CONTEXT.md` and `08-PLAN-OUTLINE.md`, so the plan was executed from the outline's Sec9
  08-04 entry, and every finding it predicted was RE-DERIVED at HEAD rather than inherited. Five
  atomic commits: `4fbd4ed` (config/{police,thief}/league.json + shared/league_config{,_fields}.py
  + shared/absent.py, D-81), `e672838` (services/reporting/league_ledger{,_fields,_bounds}.py,
  D-80), `8c6fd1e` (services/reporting/end_of_game_declaration.py -- THE first production caller),
  `daf5654` (the D7-17 draft and the checklist finding recorded CLOSED) and `b32bf9d` (graph
  refresh, 11097 nodes / 19646 edges; `graph.html` skipped, over the 5000-node viz limit).
  THE DEFECT: `build_declaration_artifact` / `write_declaration_artifact` / `DeclarationContext`
  had ZERO production callers, so `declaration_<game_id>.json` -- one of rule 50's FOUR MANDATORY
  artifacts -- had never been written by a game. CLOSED, and proven by a REAL `dev_launch` run
  (exit 0, `game_id` `397b3503b1bfa996`): both seats wrote the artifact with `repo_urls`,
  `mcp_server_addresses`, `token_ceiling` 200000, `start_time`/`end_time` taken from each seat's
  OWN wire log, and BOTH signed Step-0 envelopes embedded verbatim. Evidence committed at
  `docs/phases/phase-8/declaration-evidence/`. The call sits in `end_of_game._report` after both
  sealed artifacts and BEFORE the chain, contained SEPARATELY from the mail send -- rules 32/35
  make an unreported game cost BOTH teams everything, so a broken declaration returns None and
  logs while `EndOfGameReport.declaration_artifact` keeps the failure observable.
  RULE 38 UNMOVED: no games-played value set, defaulted or inferred. The ledger returns BOTH
  candidate counts plus an UNSET marker; the artifact's new `games_played_declared` is
  UNPARAMETERISED and names `GAMES-PLAYED-RECONSTRUCTION.md`; `league.json` carries no
  games-played leaf and a test asserts its absence. RULE 49 UNMOVED: four `null` slots rendered as
  stated-absence markers naming 08-12, with a live-mode refusal. D7-17 DRAFTED AND UNSENT.
  EIGHT PROBES, each asserted landed then reverted by rewriting the file. PROBE E FOUND A HOLE IN
  MY OWN WORK -- the max-games test moved with its own constant, so `MAX_GAMES_PER_TEAM = 11` left
  the ledger suite green on a **fixed** Table 18 row; closed by parsing the value out of
  `docs/PARAMETERS.md`. A second vacuity (a docstring stripper using `split('\"\"\"')[-1]`) was
  caught and closed before commit. Probe F removed the `declare_game` call site entirely and 7
  tests failed. Gates: 2293 passed / 0 failed (baseline 2188), coverage 97.43% (from 97.37%),
  ruff 0, line-limit 0 tree-wide with every new file also checked by path, local-truth 7 modules,
  no-LLM OK, `check_submission.py` exit 1 at 41/32/13 (unchanged -- the finding was never a row).
  Counters: suite 1923->1923 / 1916->1916 (0/0); one real game 1922->1923 / 1915->1916 (+1/+1).
  Two structural ledgers (`DURABLE_WRITE_BINDERS`, the log-artifact reacher list) and one test
  fixture correctly flagged the new modules and were updated honestly, not exempted.
  Self-check PASSED: 23 created paths verified present and tracked, five commits verified
  reachable. NOTHING PUSHED, NO TAG CREATED, NO REMOTE TOUCHED -- `git tag -l` is empty and 131
  commits sit ahead of `origin/main`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 08-04 is closed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 8`
  continuing wave 1: 08-03 (publication hygiene -- seven registered GAPs, `LICENSE` blocked on
  OQ8-5, and it should re-count the tracked config JSONs now that league.json added two) and
  08-05 (deferred #13/#19, where `turn_buffer.py` sits at 146/150 and needs a SPLIT).

Last session: 2026-08-17T18:40:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 08-01 and 08-02 in full. NEITHER PLAN FILE EXISTED -- the phase directory
  holds only `08-CONTEXT.md` and `08-PLAN-OUTLINE.md`, so both were executed from the outline's
  Sec9 entries, and every finding the outline predicted was RE-DERIVED against the tree rather
  than inherited. Two commits, each atomic: 08-01 the Sec17 + Table-5 audit gate (`4b63ee7`,
  21 files) and 08-02 the project-wide tracker reconciliation (`aeb7272`, 10 files, ONE commit
  by design). 08-01 delivers `scripts/check_submission.py` + 12 siblings and
  `docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md`: 86 rows re-derived from the tree on every run, 41 PASS /
  32 GAP / 13 UNJUDGED, exit 0/1/2 with 2 meaning the evidence set judged NOTHING and OUTRANKING
  a run that found 32 real gaps. Thirteen probes, one counter-control per group, each asserting
  the mutation LANDED first; probe 11 and a test mutation each found a defect in this plan's own
  work (positional row ids, and a mermaid test that `.match`'s own anchoring made vacuous), both
  fixed rather than reported. 08-02 rebuilt `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` from the verification
  artifacts -- header 74 -> 77 counted, 6 -> 48 ticks each citing a verbatim quote the new
  `check_requirements_ledger.py` reads back -- and moved `docs/TODO.md`, the ROADMAP Progress
  table, `docs/phases/phase-1/TODO.md` and `docs/phases/phase-8/TODO.md` in the same commit.
  Phases 4, 7 and 8 are shown INCOMPLETE because that is what their artifacts say. The flip probe
  found a hole in the ledger gate -- an open row's own citation made a `[ ]` -> `[x]` flip pass --
  closed by an evidence/status marker split plus a per-family declared-tick-count cross-check
  that catches a flip in either direction. Gates: 2188 passed / 0 failed (baseline 2153),
  coverage 97.37% unchanged, ruff 0, line limit exit 0 including all twenty new `.py` files by
  path, local-truth 7 modules, no-LLM OK, ledger gate exit 0, audit gate exit 1 with its 32
  registered gaps. Rule-38 counters: police 1922 -> 1922, thief 1915 -> 1915, delta 0/0;
  `git diff config/` empty. Both summaries written with every number taken from a command run in
  this session; self-check PASSED for both (32 paths verified present AND tracked AND not
  gitignored, both commits verified reachable, and three numbers in `SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md`
  CORRECTED rather than left -- they were probe-state values, not HEAD values).
  NOTHING PUSHED, NO TAG CREATED, NO REMOTE TOUCHED: `git tag -l` is empty and 125 commits sit
  ahead of `origin/main`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and both plans are closed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 8`
  continuing into the rest of wave 1: 08-03 (publication hygiene -- it inherits seven registered
  GAPs including two the outline never predicted, and `LICENSE` is blocked on OQ8-5), 08-04
  (the league ledger and the declaration artifact's first production caller) and 08-05.

Last session: 2026-08-17T13:35:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-09-PLAN.md (GATE-7 measurement + `docs/PRD_gatekeeper.md` +
  `OAUTH-RUNBOOK.md`) in full. Six commits, each atomic: Task 1 `measure_gate7.py` and its six
  siblings (`08705d9`); Task 2 the per-mechanism gatekeeper PRD (`ba72c8a`); a self-audit fix for
  the one-counter defect the gate found in its own work (`9e044d5`); the three routed findings --
  D7-18, D7-19 and the rule-25 CI job (`96495d4`); Task 3 the gate record and the runbook
  (`88d21fb`); Task 4 the graph refresh (`bb8b1da`). Gates: `ruff check .` 0 violations;
  2153 passed / 0 failed against the 2130 baseline; coverage 97.37% (baseline 97.37%, unchanged
  -- this plan adds tests, not source); `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all ten new `.py` files
  ALSO checked explicitly by path (`scripts/` is NOT enumerated by the no-arg form, which is the
  point); `check_local_truth.py` -> `OK: 7 module(s) scanned`, exit 0;
  `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK and now a CI job too; every new `.py` confirmed NOT ignored by
  git (D7-10's guard); `measure_gate7.py` exit 0, run twice with a byte-identical summary;
  `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `6694ec24875b4208`, 11 matched=true audit records per
  seat, one `audit_verdict` and one `game_over` per seat, ZERO `technical_win`, ZERO
  `watchdog_incident`; `git diff config/` EMPTY and both `reporting.json` files still `dry_run`.
  Rule-38 counters, all four: the full suite moved police 1921->1921 and thief 1914->1914 (delta
  0/0); one real game moved 1921->1922 and 1914->1915 (delta 1/1) -- and the gate script now reads
  BOTH counters itself, before and after, because it plays a real game. Secret scan over every
  new doc, script and the evidence JSON: clean. Two things are NOT byte-identical across gate
  runs and both are recorded rather than smoothed -- `generated_at`, and the local-truth gate's
  own two ERROR diagnostics from the empty-scan control, which echo the throwaway temp directory;
  the replay refusal's temp path is redacted to `<tmp>` in a field whose NAME says so, which also
  keeps a local username out of a file bound for a public repo (rule 49). One correction worth
  carrying: `git checkout --` on a probe reverts the FILE, not the probe, and it wiped
  uncommitted D7-18 work once; later probes reverted by inverse edit. A first reading of probe 9
  was also wrong (a truncated pytest tail) and was re-run cleanly for an accurate record.
  `GRAPH_REPORT.md` is a COMMUNITY DIGEST, not a node listing, so grepping it for a module path
  proves nothing -- verified by querying instead: `publish_view` at `view_publish.py:90` (degree
  17), `open_replay` at `replay_verify.py:163` (degree 12), `build_reporting_chain` at
  `end_of_game_chain.py:97` (degree 16), `LiveDashboard` at `live_app.py:47` (degree 8). Graph
  refreshed: 10473 nodes / 18679 edges / 597 communities. `07-09-SUMMARY.md` written with every
  number from a command run in this session, self-check PASSED (24 paths verified present AND
  tracked AND not gitignored, 6 commits verified reachable, and two citation errors CORRECTED
  rather than left). `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-09 row and a ticked 07-96.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-09 is closed. Next is 07-10, the phase's ONE
  `autonomous: false` plan: OAuth consent, one live send, the two README screenshots, and the
  OQ-5 games-played VALUE decision. Its procedure is `docs/phases/phase-7/OAUTH-RUNBOOK.md`,
  which states plainly that Claude must not enter credentials and must not click consent.

Last session: 2026-08-17T12:20:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-08-PLAN.md (the replay viewer -- load `log_`, recompute every hash,
  verdict banner, step/play/pause) in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the
  verifier with its three verdicts and the non-zero-turn guard ahead of every aggregate
  (`bd1ce8d`); Task 2 the two thin Tk files that render and decide nothing (`cce667a`); Task 3 the
  round trip on a real game with both sources deleted, plus the production-caller scan (`f67e6b1`).
  A fourth commit closed two findings in my own work (`cbc6e97`): `banner_colour`'s one line, which
  was untested only because its sole caller lives in the coverage-omitted `gui/`, and two inline
  literal tables inside assert-bearing loops, now named and floored. Gates: `ruff check .` 0
  violations; 2130 passed / 0 failed against the 2090 baseline; coverage 97.37% (baseline 97.29%);
  `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all fifteen new/touched files ALSO checked explicitly by path;
  `check_local_truth.py` -> `OK: 7 module(s) scanned`, exit 0 (was 5, grew by exactly two);
  `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; every new `.py` confirmed NOT ignored by git (D7-10's guard);
  `python -m pursuit.gui.replay_app --help` exit 0 and the `--once` scripted launch exit 0 against
  the REAL artifact, while a `.jsonl` path gives exit 2 with a message naming rule 18;
  `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `55fa28cbef618a19`, both seats `"matched":true`, outcome
  capture, zero `technical_win`, zero `watchdog_incident`; `git diff config/` EMPTY. Rule-38
  counters, all four: the full suite moved police 1921->1921 and thief 1914->1914 (delta 0/0); one
  real game moved 1920->1921 and 1913->1914 (delta 1/1). All four new `services/` modules at 100%
  coverage -- `replay_verdict.py`, `replay_source.py`, `replay_session.py`, `replay_verify.py` --
  and `gui/` holds 181 of the 620 new `src/` code lines, every one of them widget construction.
  AST scan over all seven of this plan's test/fixture files: 0 parametrize sites (the four tampers
  are four tests, deliberately) and 3 assert-bearing loops, two of which carried inline tables and
  are now floored. Production-caller grep over every new public name: `open_replay` <-
  `gui/replay_app.main`, `banner_colour`/`SECTION_TITLES` <- `gui/replay_panels`, and the one name
  with test-only reachability (`verdict_for`) removed rather than excused; graphify agrees
  independently -- `open_replay` at `replay_verify.py:163`, degree 11, with an incoming
  `main() [calls]` edge. Graph refreshed: 10266 nodes / 18371 edges / 588 communities.
  `07-08-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a command run in this session, self-check
  PASSED (17 paths verified present AND tracked AND not gitignored, 4 task commits verified
  reachable, and two file-size numbers CORRECTED rather than left as written).
  `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-08 row and a refreshed 07-96.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-08 is closed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 7`
  continuing into 07-09 (GATE-7 measurement + `docs/PRD_gatekeeper.md` + `OAUTH-RUNBOOK.md`), which
  must take its criterion-3 evidence through `open_replay(path).verdict` and must report all THREE
  verdict states; then the human-in-the-loop 07-10.

Last session: 2026-08-17T23:55:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-07-PLAN.md (end-of-game reporting + `result_`) in full. Three tasks, each
  committed atomically: Task 1 the rule-35 agreement record, three-valued and never inferred
  (`e61b46c`); Task 2 `result_<game_id>.json` as one durable file per series with both token totals
  (`8377916`); Task 3 the game-end hook, contained, watchdog-touching, and wired at ONE call site
  beside `record_completed_game` (`4d68886`). Two further commits closed findings in my own work:
  the per-role artifact directory that a real game proved was a rule-35 disqualifier (`5aa9ec1`),
  and three assertions of mine that measured nothing (`7081515`). Gates: `ruff check .` 0
  violations; 2090 passed / 0 failed against the 2047 baseline; coverage 97.29% (baseline 97.19%);
  `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all nineteen new `.py` files ALSO checked explicitly by path;
  `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; `check_local_truth.py` -> `OK: 5 module(s) scanned`, exit 0;
  every new `.py` and both new PRDs confirmed NOT ignored by git (D7-10's guard);
  `git diff config/{police,thief}/reporting.json` EMPTY and both still `dry_run`;
  `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `a5dd2a98827f4df5`, both seats `matched=true` at turn 5,
  ZERO `technical_win` and ZERO `watchdog_incident`, and both seats wrote their OWN `log_` and
  `result_` under `game_artifacts/<role>/`. Rule-38 counters, all four: the full suite moved police
  1920->1920 and thief 1913->1913 (delta 0/0); one real game moved 1919->1920 and 1912->1913
  (delta 1/1). All six new source modules at 100% coverage -- `result_agreement.py`,
  `result_agreement_fields.py`, `artifact_result.py`, `result_artifact_fields.py`,
  `end_of_game.py`, `end_of_game_chain.py` -- and so is every other module in
  `services/reporting/`. `agent_entrypoint.py` measured 103 -> 107 of its 150 permitted code lines.
  AST scan over all thirteen of this plan's test/fixture files: 0 parametrize sites, 4
  assert-bearing loops, every one floored. Production-caller grep over all 25 new public names:
  every one referenced in `src/` outside its defining module, and `report_game_end` reaches
  `network/agent_entrypoint.py` -- D7-14 closed, and `test_log_artifact_reachability.py` now NAMES
  the `log_` builder's five reachers so its empty-list assertion cannot be green because the
  builder is dead code. Two per-mechanism PRDs written per CLAUDE.md Sec2.3:
  `docs/PRD_result_artifact.md` and `docs/PRD_end_of_game.md`. Graphify refreshed -- 10027 nodes /
  17957 edges / 575 communities; `graphify explain report_game_end` resolves to
  `end_of_game.py:89` (degree 16, `--> _report()`) and `record_sub_game` to
  `artifact_result.py:147` (degree 9). `07-07-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a run in
  this session, self-check PASSED (26 paths verified present AND tracked, 5 task commits verified
  reachable, and five file-size numbers CORRECTED rather than left as written).
  `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-07 row and a refreshed 07-96; D7-14 closed, and
  D7-17 (`game_id` is minted per GAME while PARAMETERS reads it as the SERIES id) and D7-18 (a
  QuotaManager path is unguarded against the shipped `config/` tree) filed in the phase's
  `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-07 is closed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 7`
  continuing into 07-08 (the replay viewer), which must floor `verify_log_turns` on
  `committed > 0`, inherits D7-8 and the 07-06 quantisation rule, and now also reads `result_`
  from `game_artifacts/<role>/`; then 07-09 and the human-in-the-loop 07-10.

Last session: 2026-08-17T22:40:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-06-PLAN.md (the live GUI -- a separate process over a published
  LocalView snapshot) in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the best-effort
  publisher plus its read half, the one call site in `maybe_resolve`, and the leak scan run over
  the WRITTEN FILE with its five-variant counter-control (`56e4d96`); Task 2 the five thin `gui/`
  files over `sdk/view_render.py` + `sdk/view_text.py`, and the runtime recovery test that found
  the quantisation channel (`840636b`); Task 3 the local-truth gate turned green BY CODE with
  D7-9's three blind spots measured open then closed, split at 198 lines into
  `scripts/local_truth_ast.py` (`ad46940`). A fourth commit closed four findings in my own work
  (`dea2a60`): `lit_cells`'s test-only reachability wired into `view_text._support`, one unguarded
  assert-bearing loop rewritten as a set comparison, both inline parametrize tables named and
  floored, and the last uncovered branch (a scent-free view) covered. Gates: `ruff check .` 0
  violations; 2047 passed / 0 failed against the 1974 baseline; coverage 97.19% (baseline 97.12%);
  `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all twenty-one new/touched files ALSO checked explicitly by
  path; `check_local_truth.py` -> `OK: 5 module(s) scanned`, exit 0, and the `.sh` wrapper the same;
  `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; every new `.py` confirmed NOT ignored by git (D7-10's guard);
  grep of `gui/` for the four forbidden spellings -> no hits, prose included;
  `python -m pursuit.gui.live_app --help` exit 0 with `--refresh-ms` shown as required and exit 2
  when it is omitted; `--once` scripted launch exit 0 against a synthetic snapshot AND against both
  seats of the real game; `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `2db6cc8b039c82e7`, both seats
  matched=true, outcome capture, zero `technical_win`, zero `watchdog_incident`. Rule-38
  counters, all four: the full suite moved police 1918->1918 and thief 1911->1911 (delta 0/0); one
  real game moved 1917->1918 and 1910->1911 (delta 1/1). All four new sdk modules at 100% coverage:
  view_publish.py, view_snapshot.py, view_render.py, view_text.py; `gui/` is coverage-omitted and
  holds 200 of the 579 new `src/` code lines (34.5%), every one of them widget construction, which
  `test_gui_structural.py` enforces structurally. AST parametrize/loop scan over all six of this
  plan's test files: 2 parametrize sites, both now NAMED and floored; 4 assert-bearing loops, three
  already guarded and one found UNGUARDED and rewritten. Graphify refreshed -- 9734 nodes / 17412
  edges / 579 communities; `graphify explain publish_view` resolves to `view_publish.py:90`
  (degree 17, edge in from `maybe_resolve`) and `LiveDashboard` to `live_app.py:47`.
  `07-06-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a run in this session, self-check PASSED (25
  paths and 4 task commits verified, every new source/test file additionally verified TRACKED by
  git, and the `gui/` line share recomputed independently at 200/579 = 34.5%).
  `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-06 row and a refreshed 07-96; D7-6, D7-7 and D7-9
  marked RESOLVED and D7-15/D7-16 filed in the phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-06 is closed. Wave 2 of phase 7 is COMPLETE. Next is
  `/gsd:execute-phase 7` continuing into 07-07 (end-of-game reporting + `result_`), which owns
  D7-13/D7-14 and the D7-3/D7-12 wiring; then 07-08, 07-09 and the human-in-the-loop 07-10.

Last session: 2026-08-17T16:10:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-05-PLAN.md (the log_ artifact -- wire JSONL x nonce ledger, joined on
  local turn truth) in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the join, the
  crash-tolerant reader and the adversarial disjoint-turn fixture (`3f503b2`), Task 2 the
  artifact, its seal and the deleted-sources integration proof (`e6ea7f0`), Task 3 the nonce
  boundary pinned as a SCAN rather than recorded as a grep, plus `docs/PRD_log_artifact.md`
  (`1d0a47d`). Three further commits closed findings in my own work: the four defensive branches
  coverage exposed and the last unguarded assert-bearing loop (`fdb95eb`), the D-61 two-game_uid
  fix (`4787e11`), and trimming log_join.py off the exact 150/150 limit (`34169fd`). Gates:
  `ruff check .` 0 violations; 1974 passed / 0 failed against the 1919 baseline; coverage 97.12%
  (baseline 97.02%); `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all twelve new files ALSO checked
  explicitly by path (the no-arg form enumerates via git ls-files and passes VACUOUSLY on an
  untracked file); `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; every new `.py` confirmed NOT ignored by git
  (D7-10's guard); `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `521519a78f96c255`, both seats
  `"matched":true`, outcome capture at turn 5. Rule-38 counters, all four: the full suite moved
  police 1916->1916 and thief 1909->1909 (delta 0/0); one real game moved 1916->1917 and
  1909->1910 (delta 1/1). All five new modules at 100% coverage: log_join.py, log_read.py,
  log_turn_fields.py, log_artifact_fields.py, artifact_log.py. AST parametrize scan over all
  seven of this plan's test/fixture files: 3 sites, two named sources both length-guarded and one
  inline 5-element literal with a positive control; 2 assert-bearing loops, one already guarded
  and one -- over LOG_ARTIFACT_MODULES -- found UNGUARDED and now floored at 4. Graphify refreshed
  -- 9449 nodes / 16882 edges; `graphify explain write_log_artifact` resolves to
  `artifact_log.py:129` (degree 14) and `join_game` to `log_join.py:119` (degree 25); graph.html
  skipped by the tool at 9449 nodes against its 5000 viz limit, and it is a gitignored local-only
  artifact anyway. `07-05-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a run in this session,
  self-check PASSED (19 paths and 5 task commits verified, and every new source/test file
  additionally verified TRACKED by git). `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-05 row
  with its measured evidence; D7-13 and D7-14 filed in the phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-05 is closed. Wave 2 of phase 7 continues
  (`/gsd:execute-phase 7`): 07-06 (live GUI) is the last wave-2 plan. 07-07 is now fully
  unblocked and owns D7-13/D7-14; 07-08 consumes `verify_log_turns` and must floor it on
  `committed > 0`.

Last session: 2026-08-17T11:40:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-04-PLAN.md (the mail transport -- attached JSON, send-only scope, 429
  handled by the ONE gatekeeper) in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the
  MIME shape asserted by re-parsing the rendered bytes (`86d9547` -- 17 tests, with the body
  and header leak checks each paired with a control that plants the distinctive value and
  requires the check to FAIL), Task 2 the MailSink protocol and DryRunSink plus the
  durable_write_bytes / write_artifact_bytes extractions (`c196535` -- 9 tests that claim only
  what a disk write can claim), Task 3 GmailSink against an injected fake transport
  (`6b686cd` -- 47 tests across three files, none satisfiable by DryRunSink). Gates:
  `ruff check .` 0 violations; 1919 passed / 0 failed against the 1846 baseline; coverage
  97.02% (baseline 96.95%); `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all twelve new/touched files
  ALSO checked explicitly by path; `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; `uv lock --check` current
  and no requirements.txt exists; `git diff config/` EMPTY; `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0
  with outcome capture and 11 `"matched":true` audit verdicts per side, zero STEP0_MISMATCH,
  zero technical_win. Rule-38 counters, all four: the full suite moved police 1915->1915 and
  thief 1908->1908 (delta 0/0); one real game moved 1915->1916 and 1908->1909 (delta 1/1).
  Every new or touched module at 100% coverage: message.py, sink.py, gmail_sink.py,
  artifacts.py, durable_write.py. Collected test counts re-read from pytest rather than
  counted by hand -- 17 / 9 / 12 / 15 / 20 = 73, exactly the suite delta. Every parametrize
  site in this plan's five test files is length-guarded (4 sites, 4 guards), because an
  emptied table SKIPS silently. Graphify refreshed -- 9250 nodes / 16532 edges,
  `graphify explain GmailSink` resolves to `gmail_sink.py:153`. `07-04-SUMMARY.md` written
  with every number from a run in this session, self-check PASSED (18 paths and 3 commits
  verified, and the nine new source/test files additionally verified TRACKED by git -- the
  check that would have caught D7-10 on its own). `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked
  07-04 row and moves 07-96 to in-progress; D7-10 (RESOLVED), D7-11 and D7-12 filed in the
  phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-04 is closed. Wave 2 of phase 7 continues
  (`/gsd:execute-phase 7`): 07-05 (log_ builder) and 07-06 (live GUI). 07-07 consumes this
  plan's ReportingChain + sink wiring and owns D7-12.

Stopped at: Completed 07-11-PLAN.md (the display belief -- rules 8-9 recovery, not absence)
  in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the RED reproduction on fixtures
  rebuilt to model production (`4c4c03d` -- 9 failed / 45 passed, including 07-03's OWN
  load-bearing absence test failing at `$.belief.argmax: pair [5, 3]`, with both anti-vacuity
  controls passing so the attack was proven to fire before being used as evidence), Task 2 the
  root-cause fix at the strategy layer with option (a) reasoned in source and in the new
  `docs/PRD_display_belief.md` (`19aa946`), Task 3 the three false docstrings corrected and the
  byte-level thief control added (`df041a0`). Gates: `ruff check .` 0 violations; 1846 passed /
  0 failed against the 1826 baseline; coverage 96.95% (baseline 96.95%); `check_line_limit.sh`
  exit 0 with all nine new files ALSO checked explicitly by path; `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py`
  OK; `dev_launch.py` exit 0 with both sides `"matched":true`. Rule-38 counters, all four:
  the full suite moved police 1914->1914 and thief 1907->1907 (delta 0/0); one real game moved
  1914->1915 and 1907->1908 (delta 1/1). Graphify refreshed -- `DisplayBelief` at
  `display_belief.py:50`, degree 25, edges to BeliefMap/ScentField/DisplayFloors and from
  BeliefAdapter. `07-11-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a run in this session,
  self-check PASSED (23 files and 3 commits verified). `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a
  ticked 07-11 row; D7-8 and D7-9 filed in the phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-11 is closed. Wave 2 of phase 7 is next
  (`/gsd:execute-phase 7`): 07-04, 07-05, and 07-06, which was BLOCKED on this plan and is
  now unblocked. 07-08 is likewise unblocked but inherits D7-8.

Last session: 2026-08-17T05:40:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-03-PLAN.md (the rules 8-9 local-truth firewall) in full. Three
  tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the RED tests taken BEFORE the fix (`70df24a`
  -- two collection ERRORs naming the missing modules and 8 failures naming the missing
  script, quoted verbatim in the commit message), Task 2 `LocalView` + `view_builder`
  outside `gui/` (`f7d21c6`), Task 3 the CI gate wired and loud on an empty scan
  (`1ccd4ea`). Two further commits closed self-audit findings in my own work: the
  unpinned entropy value plus the 150-line test split (`094eb12`), and the two unguarded
  literal sets plus an unreachable `None` annotation (`7c69f81`). `07-03-SUMMARY.md`
  written with the three pre-fix failures verbatim, the production-caller grep, the
  thirty probe counts and the noted absence of `check_no_llm_in_strategy.sh` from CI.
  `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` row 07-03 ticked with its measured evidence; D7-6 and
  D7-7 filed in the phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- wave 1 of phase 7 is complete and the tree is clean. Next is
  `/gsd:execute-phase 7` continuing into wave 2 (07-04, 07-05, 07-06).

Last session: 2026-08-04T12:31:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 03-11-PLAN.md (graph primitives, run-2 wave 1's first plan) in
  full. All 3 tasks executed TDD (tests written and confirmed red before each
  implementation went green), each committed atomically: Task 1 `components.py`
  (`12be2e4`), Task 2 `cycles.py` (`52c85f2`), Task 3 `territory.py` (`b4b06fa`). A
  4th commit (`af5f0de`) closed a Rule-2 coverage gap found during final verification
  (two documented contract branches -- the DFS-root cut-vertex case and
  `cycle_rank(frozenset())==0` -- had no direct test; 2 tests added, package coverage
  98%->100%). `03-11-SUMMARY.md` written. Full repo gates green: `ruff check .` 0
  violations, line-limit clean (new files 100/37/55/32 code lines), 456 passed / 2
  skipped (the pre-existing GATE-4 skip, untouched), coverage 97.05% (>=85% floor).
  Graphify rebuilt and `GRAPH_REPORT.md` refreshed (3457 nodes/6273 edges/234
  communities). `docs/phases/phase-3/TODO.md` deliberately not touched -- its
  03-11..03-16 row numbering predates the 15-plan wave breakdown and reconciling it is
  03-24's ("triplet refresh") explicit job.
Resume file: None. **Phases 1-6 are complete and verified. Phase 7 is 11.5 of 12; phase 8 is
  11 of 14. Everything that can be done without a human is done.**

  Phase 7: plans 07-01..07-09 and 07-11 all executed and committed. **07-10 is PARTIAL (row
  marked in `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md`)** -- OAuth client, consent, cached send-only token
  and BOTH README screenshots are DONE as of 2026-08-18; the one live send and the OQ-5
  games-played decision remain. GATE-7: criteria 2 and 3 PASS, criterion 1 is `dry_run` PASS
  with the live half honestly PENDING, and `GATE-7-MEASUREMENT.md` opens by saying criterion 1
  is not closed by that document.

  Phase 8: 08-01..08-11 executed. 08-12 (publish), 08-13 (league), 08-14 (submit) are all
  `autonomous: false`. `scripts/check_submission.py` is at **73 PASS / 1 GAP / 13 UNJUDGED**;
  the single remaining GAP is **G6-08, the Git tag**, which is cut and pushed by a human at
  08-12 and never by the gate. GATE-8 opens with "GATE-8 IS NOT MET" and defines exit 0 as
  "everything true before a human acts".

  **Five decisions belong to the human and none is invented anywhere in the repo:** the
  games-played VALUE (rule 38, absolute -- evidence in
  `docs/phases/phase-7/GAMES-PLAYED-RECONSTRUCTION.md`, options A/B/C, none selected), the
  self-assessment score, the licence (MIT PREPARED, `AWAITING_OWNER_CONFIRMATION`, and
  `pyproject.toml` deliberately avoids the SPDX string), the four rule-49 repo URLs (all
  `null` in `config/*/league.json`), and D7-17 (drafted, unsent, at
  `docs/phases/phase-8/D7-17-QUESTION-FOR-THE-LECTURER.md`).

  **Operational facts a new session needs.** The live send is deliberately deferred to league
  day: `reporting.recipient` is FIXED to the lecturer's address and
  `shared/reporting_config.py` rejects any other value, so any send before a real league game
  mails the lecturer a report for a two-machine test game. Both `reporting.json` files ship
  `dry_run` and must stay that way until 08-13. The OAuth token lives OUTSIDE the repo and is
  reached only through the env-var NAMES in `config/*/reporting.json`
  (`PURSUIT_GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH`, `PURSUIT_GMAIL_TOKEN_PATH`); its granted scope was
  measured as exactly `gmail.send`. While the user is still iterating on two of their own
  machines, `game_artifacts/` is excluded LOCALLY via `.git/info/exclude` (not committed) so
  test games are never published as league evidence -- that line is removed on league day, when
  real evidence becomes committable. The user pushes to `origin` themselves; Claude does not
  push, tag, or touch remotes.

  The two split repositories are built and tagged under `C:/Users/Hp/pursuit-split-repos/`
  (`pursuit-police`, `pursuit-thief`), each with `v1.00`, **zero remotes**, and each passing
  the full Table-5 gate in its own tree. They are rebuilt from source by the 08-10 script, so
  further code changes flow through on the next rebuild -- which is why 08-12 should be done
  LAST, after the cop and thief are accepted.
