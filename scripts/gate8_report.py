"""Assembles the GATE-8 evidence JSON and computes its exit code (08-11).

INHERITED WHOLE FROM `gate7_report.py`, because 07-09 already argued it: one
place where the verdicts are computed FROM the numbers, no threshold invented
here, an empty evidence set reported separately (exit 2) from a failure (exit 1),
and -- the rule this gate needs most --

    NO CRITERION IS EVER A BLANKET PASS.

All three GATE-8 criteria are structurally human-completed. Each therefore
carries its measurable half and its human half as two NAMED fields, and the
criterion-level `verdict` is the string that joins them, so a grep for
`"verdict": "PASS"` cannot match a criterion nobody has finished. Writing GATE-8
PASS on the strength of preparation is the failure mode 07-09 refused and the
08 outline names as this plan's second trap.
