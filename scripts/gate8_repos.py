"""GATE-8 criterion 1 -- the two repositories and the tag, measured (08-11).

THREE HALVES, NOT ONE VERDICT. `built` and `tagged` are measurable on this
machine today; **`published` is not, and is reported PENDING** -- creating a
GitHub repository and pushing to it needs an account, a consent screen and an
irreversible outward call, all of which are 08-12's human's.

`remote_count` USED TO BE ASSERTED AS ZERO, as evidence that nothing had been
published from here. That reading expired the moment the owner published
(2026-08-19) and made a correct build report FAIL. Publication is now MEASURED
by `gate8_publication`, and this module reports the facts without judging them.
