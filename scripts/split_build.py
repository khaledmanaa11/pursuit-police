"""Materialising one split repository on disk, outside this tree (08-10, D-76).

NOTHING HERE TOUCHES A REMOTE. Every git call is `init`, `add`, `commit`,
`remote` (a read), `rev-parse` or `rev-list`. There is no `push`, no `remote
add`, no `fetch` and no `tag` anywhere in this module, and `assert_no_remotes`
turns that from an intention into a checked property of the built tree. Pushing
is 08-12, and it is a human's decision on a human's account.

THE DESTINATION IS CHECKED AGAINST THE SOURCE. `git init` inside the development
working tree gives the new repository the old one's history and its `origin`; a
single reflex `git push` then publishes several hundred private commits to a
public URL. `prepare_destination` refuses any destination at or under the source
root, and the refusal is proven by making it happen in
`tests/unit/test_split_build.py`.

FILES ARE STAGED BY EXPLICIT PATHSPEC, never `git add -A`. The list comes from
`split_manifest`, is written to a NUL-separated file and handed to git with
`--pathspec-from-file`, so what is committed is exactly what the manifest said
and a stray file in the destination cannot join the commit by accident.
