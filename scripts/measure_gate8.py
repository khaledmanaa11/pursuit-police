"""GATE-8 measurement CLI (08-11): the submission gate, measured as far as it
can honestly go before a human acts.

    uv run python scripts/measure_gate8.py
    uv run python scripts/measure_gate8.py --dest C:/Users/Hp/pursuit-split-repos

EXIT 0 DOES NOT MEAN GATE-8 IS MET. All three Sec-submission criteria are
structurally human-completed -- publishing two repositories, filling and
submitting a form PDF, and playing scored games against real opponents. This
command measures the halves that exist on this machine and reports the other
halves as PENDING; `docs/phases/phase-8/GATE-8-MEASUREMENT.md` is the record
that carries them, and it does not read PASS.

THIS COMMAND ISSUES NO REMOTE COMMAND. Every git call it makes is a local read,
and it verifies that claim about its own source before reporting it -- see
`gate8_common.network_verb_hits`. It does not create the tag either: 08-11 cuts
that in each output by hand, and this gate only measures what is there.

Idempotent: reads only, one output JSON, overwritten in place. Two fields move
between runs and both are named -- `generated_at`, and the counter snapshot,
which is recorded before and after precisely so a run that moved a rule-38
counter cannot hide it.
