# Publish runbook — creating and pushing the two submission repositories

**Owner:** 08-11 (written) · **Run by:** a human, at **08-12** · **Prerequisite:** 08-10's build
and 08-11's tag, both already on disk.

> **What Claude cannot do, stated once and meant throughout this file.** No agent in this
> project may **enter credentials**, **click a consent screen**, **create a GitHub repository**,
> **add a remote**, **push**, **push a tag**, or **send mail**. Every step below that does one of
> those is marked **HUMAN**. The steps marked **CHECK** are local reads a human can run, or ask an
> agent to run, at any time. 08-10 and 08-11 between them created two repositories on disk with
> **zero remotes** and one annotated tag each, and issued **no remote command of any kind**.

Rule 41 (a tag on the submitted version), rule 49 (two cross-linked public repositories) and
rule 50 (what each must contain) are closed by this runbook and by nothing else.

## 0. Before anything — the two blockers, BOTH ANSWERED 2026-08-19

Both were the owner's to answer and both were answered in session. Recorded here with what
followed from each, because the consequence of the first one is a check, not a note.

| Blocker | Answer | What followed |
|---|---|---|
| **OQ8-9 — is `origin` public or private?** | **PUBLIC.** The owner opened `https://github.com/khaledmanaa11/AI_ORCHISTRATION_final_project.git` and confirmed it loads. | Everything this repository has ever tracked is **already published**, so the secrets question became **urgent rather than preventive** — and was answered by scanning HISTORY, not the working tree (below). |
| **OQ8-5 — the licence** | **MIT, adopted.** The owner confirmed in session; `LICENSE`'s `PREPARED, NOT ADOPTED` block is deleted and `docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` reads `CONFIRMED_BY_THE_OWNER`. | The biconditional in `tests/unit/test_packaging_metadata.py` now holds on the confirmed side; the README `## Licence` section was the THIRD site and was rewritten in the same commit. |

**The history scan `origin`-is-public forced, and its result.** `scripts/submission_scan.py`
(row G4-02) reads **tracked files at HEAD** — which is the right scope for "what will we
publish" and the wrong scope for "what have we already published". A credential committed and
later deleted is invisible to it and permanently visible on GitHub. So history was scanned
directly, and the record is the command as much as the verdict:

```bash
for p in 'sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9]{8,}' 'AIza[A-Za-z0-9_\-]{20,}' 'ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}'; do
    git log --all --oneline -G"$p"
done
git log --all --oneline --name-only --diff-filter=A |
  grep -iE "client_secret|credentials\.json|token\.json|\.env$|\.pem$|\.key$|service.account"
```

**Both returned empty across every commit on every ref.** No provider-shaped key was ever
committed, and no credential-bearing file was ever added and removed. `origin` being public
is therefore not a disclosure. This is a **negative result from a scanner proven to match**
— the provider patterns are 08-03's, which carry a planted-secret positive control.

**The licence's two halves cannot drift apart.** `tests/unit/test_packaging_metadata.py` holds `LICENSE` and the `LICENCE STATUS` field in `docs/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` as a **biconditional**: while the file carries its `PREPARED, NOT ADOPTED` block the field must read the
awaiting-confirmation token, and when the block is deleted the field must read the confirmed one. Removing one and forgetting the other breaks the suite rather than shipping quietly. Both moved together on 2026-08-19.

**An observation recorded rather than acted on.** During phases 7 and 8 this repository's
`origin/main` moved **without any agent pushing it** — verified on 2026-08-14 and 2026-08-16,
with no pushing git hook in the tree. Something outside this repository pushes it on a delay.
Two consequences for this runbook: (1) do not assume `origin` is under manual control when
answering OQ8-9; (2) **08-11 deliberately did not cut a tag in this repository**, only in the two
split outputs, because a local tag here could be swept outward by that process. See
`docs/phases/phase-8/GATE-8-MEASUREMENT.md` criterion 1.

---

## 1. Rebuild the two outputs — CHECK

The outputs on disk are one or more commits behind by construction: every plan's own summary
lands after the build it describes. The build is idempotent and is one command.

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_split_repos.py --dest C:/Users/Hp/pursuit-split-repos --replace --gates \
    --with-history --json docs/phases/phase-8/split_build_evidence.json
```

**`--with-history` carries this repository's commit history into each output** (D-83).
`docs/SEGAL_GUIDELINES.md:325` grades *orderly Git history* among the Extensibility &
standards items, and it is judged on the repository handed in -- an output with one
commit hides every commit of TDD from the one reader they were kept for. Omitting the
flag builds 08-10's original shape: one commit, history disjoint from this repository.

**The flag reverses a documented safety property, and REPLACES it rather than dropping
it.** `split_build.py` refuses to build inside this tree precisely because a clone
inherits this repository's `origin`, so one reflex `git push` publishes private history.
That reasoning held while this repository was private. It is now public (OQ8-9, answered
2026-08-19), so the history is already published and the clone discloses nothing new --
and `clone_history` removes the inherited remote before returning, which `no_remote_row`
then re-checks from outside. A freshly built output has nothing to push to.

Two verification rows change meaning with the flag, together and never one alone:

| Without `--with-history` | With `--with-history` |
|---|---|
| `exactly one commit` | `development history preserved` -- the count must equal this repository's own count **plus exactly one**, so a shallow or truncated clone fails rather than shipping with holes |
| `history disjoint from the source repository` | `history rooted in the source repository` -- the import commit must be **new** and descend **directly** from this repository's HEAD |

Exit 0 means every row of every output passed, including `uv sync`, `ruff check .`,
`pytest --cov` and the line-limit scan **inside each output**. Exit 2 means the build produced
no rows and is **not** a pass. Full detail: [`SPLIT-RUNBOOK.md`](SPLIT-RUNBOOK.md).

**`--replace` deletes and rewrites the output trees, and that deletes their tags.** Re-cut the
tag after any rebuild — step 2.

## 2. Re-cut the tag in each output — CHECK

The tag name is **derived** from `src/pursuit/shared/version.py` (`VERSION = "1.00"`), never
chosen: `v1.00`. `pyproject.toml` carries the same string, pinned by
`tests/unit/test_version_single_source.py`.

```bash
cd C:/Users/Hp/pursuit-split-repos/pursuit-police
git tag -a v1.00 -m "Submission version 1.00 -- police (cop) repository, team khm-mn17"
cd ../pursuit-thief
git tag -a v1.00 -m "Submission version 1.00 -- thief repository, team khm-mn17"
```

Then verify, from this repository:

```bash
uv run python scripts/measure_gate8.py
```

Criterion 1 must read `BUILT+TAGGED PASS; PUBLISHED PENDING (08-12)`. The gate checks that each
tag is **annotated**, points at that output's `HEAD`, and lists exactly as many files as
`git ls-files` reports — a tag on the wrong commit is the failure this row exists to catch.

## 3. Create the two public repositories — **HUMAN**

Two repositories, named to match the two outputs. Nothing else about them is prescribed by the
rules; keep the names distinguishable and stable, because they go into the submission form
(rule 49) and into `config/*/league.json`.

- `pursuit-police` — the **cop** agent
- `pursuit-thief` — the **thief** agent

Create them **empty** — no README, no `.gitignore`, no licence chosen in the GitHub UI. Each
output already contains all three, and an auto-generated file makes the first push a conflict.

## 4. Add a remote and push — **HUMAN**

```bash
cd C:/Users/Hp/pursuit-split-repos/pursuit-police
git remote add origin <the police repository URL>
git push -u origin main
git push origin v1.00

cd ../pursuit-thief
git remote add origin <the thief repository URL>
git push -u origin main
git push origin v1.00
```

**Type these in the output directories, never in the development repository.** The outputs live
outside this tree precisely so that a `git push` typed in the wrong window cannot reach a public
URL: this repository's `main` is well over a hundred commits ahead of its own remote and its
history is private working history.

Push the tag **explicitly by name**, as above. `git push --tags` in the wrong window is the
irreversible mistake this whole phase is arranged to avoid.

## 5. Fill the four real links — **HUMAN**, then CHECK

Rule 49 wants two links in the form and **four** links in both teams' JSON. Four slots are named
individually in `config/police/league.json` and `config/thief/league.json`; all four read `null`
today, which the loader renders as a stated-absent marker and **refuses** when
`reporting.mode = live`.

1. Set `league.repo_urls.own_cop` and `own_thief` in **both** roles' `league.json` to the two
   URLs from step 3. Leave `opponent_cop`/`opponent_thief` `null` until league day.
2. Replace the stated-absent markers in each output's `README.md` cross-link banner with the two
   real URLs — **both** READMEs name **both** repositories.
3. Re-run the audit and the tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_league_config.py tests/unit/test_split_verify.py -q
uv run python scripts/check_submission.py
```

## 6. Re-run the publication scan against the pushed trees — CHECK

There is **no** `check_publication_safety.py` in this repository; the scan is group 4 of the
audit gate (`scripts/submission_security.py`, 15 rows, currently 15 PASS / 0 GAP) plus
`tests/unit/test_publication_ignore_rules.py`. Run both **inside a fresh clone of each pushed
repository**, not in the output directory you pushed from:

```bash
git clone <the police repository URL> /tmp/verify-police && cd /tmp/verify-police
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks
uv sync && uv run python scripts/check_submission.py && uv run pytest --cov
```

A fresh clone is the point. 08-10 found **four** tests that asserted the developer's untracked
files rather than the repository — including a rule-38 README leak detector that searched an
**empty** value set in every clone and therefore guarded nothing. They pass in a clone now
because that was fixed; re-running here is how it stays fixed.

Confirm by eye, in the clone: no `.env`, no `police_thief_p2p.pdf`, no `requirements.txt`, no
`config/*/games_played.json`.

## 7. Send the D7-17 question to the lecturer — **HUMAN**

The question is drafted and **unsent**:
[`D7-17-QUESTION-FOR-THE-LECTURER.md`](D7-17-QUESTION-FOR-THE-LECTURER.md). Send it to
`rmisegal@gmail.com` from the human's own mail client. **No agent may send it** — mailing the
lecturer is an outward act under a person's identity. Record the date sent at the top of that
file when it goes.

## Done when

| | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Both repositories reachable and public | opened while signed out |
| Each README cross-links the other, with real URLs | rule 49 |
| `v1.00` visible on both, on the pushed `main` | rule 41 |
| `league.json` holds the two own-team URLs in both roles | `check_submission.py` placeholder row |
| A fresh clone of each passes `ruff`, `pytest --cov`, the line-limit gate and the audit | Table 5, inside the published tree |
| The D7-17 question is sent and dated | OQ8-1 |

Then: [`LEAGUE-RUNBOOK.md`](LEAGUE-RUNBOOK.md) (08-13), which additionally needs **07-10**.
