"""The GATE-8 measurement's own contract (08-11).

`scripts/` is outside `check_line_limit.sh`'s globs and outside the coverage
source set, so a measurement script is the easiest place in this repository for
an untested branch to live. These tests ask the three questions that matter
about a gate: does its exit code discriminate, can its evidence set be empty
without saying so, and are the two crude scans it trusts actually able to fire?

THE ONE THING THIS FILE CHECKS THAT NO OTHER TEST CAN: that the GATE-8 package
issues **no remote git command**. It is asserted over the package's real source,
and the detector is fired on a planted `push` line first -- an all-clear from a
scanner that matches nothing is not an all-clear.
