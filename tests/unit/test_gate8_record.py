"""`GATE-8-MEASUREMENT.md` may not drift from what was measured (08-11).

The gate record is the document a grader reads instead of running anything, so
the two failure modes worth testing are **drift** and **overstatement**:

* **drift** -- the three criterion verdict STRINGS are read out of
  `gate8_measurement_evidence.json` and required to appear verbatim in the
  document. Re-running the measurement and hand-editing the prose to something
  friendlier fails here.
* **overstatement** -- the record must say GATE-8 is not met, must carry a
  PENDING for each human-completed half, and must name who closes each one.
  07-09 refused a gate that reported PASS on the strength of preparation; this
  test is that refusal made mechanical.
