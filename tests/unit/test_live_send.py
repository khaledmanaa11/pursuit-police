"""The live send CORE's contract (07-10), driven with a FAKE transport.

No credential, no network, no browser: `live_send.send_once` takes its
transport builder as a seam, exactly as `build_gmail_transport` takes its
credentials loader. What is asserted here is the half a fake CAN prove -- that
the shipped chain is the one used, that the JSON arrives ATTACHED, and that the
two hazards this script exists to remove really are removed. The delivered
half stays a human's, and this file does not pretend otherwise.

THE TWO STRUCTURAL GUARDS ARE THE POINT. `test_the_shipped_config_is_never
_written` fires on the file's bytes, and the league-config guard reads the
module's own source: both encode a claim the docstring makes, so a later edit
that quietly reintroduces the flip-on-disk or routes this through
`report_game_end` fails here instead of on league day.
