"""A REAL game writes a REAL `declaration_<game_id>.json`, and its keys are
checked against `docs/PARAMETERS.md:165` read out of the document.

THE DEFECT THIS FILE CLOSES. 08-01 re-derived at HEAD that
`build_declaration_artifact`, `write_declaration_artifact` and
`DeclarationContext` had ZERO production callers. `declaration_<game_id>.json`
is one of rule 50's four MANDATORY artifacts, so PARAMETERS' declaration
content had never been written by a game. Everything here therefore runs
against `played_game`'s real two-peer match and its real signed Step-0
envelope -- a synthetic context would prove the wrapper works, which was never
in doubt, and not that a game calls it.
